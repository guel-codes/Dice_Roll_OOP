# Dice_Roll_OOP Activity
 This project was made to practice using OOP.

 ## Instructions:
- Creat a Dice class
- A method called roll_dice that randomly rolls the dice 
- Two attributes: min_roll and max_roll
- Prompt user for name
- Tell user if they win based off of roll

## Additional Requirements to add later:
- Incorparate a win counter so when the user quits they have a total of their wins
